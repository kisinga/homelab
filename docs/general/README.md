# Homelab Infrastructure

This repository contains the infrastructure-as-code for a personal homelab, designed for simplicity, security, and automated maintenance.

## Overview

The philosophy of this homelab is to be:

- **Declarative**: The entire state of the system is defined in this Git repository.
- **Automated**: Changes pushed to the `main` branch are automatically deployed.
- **Secure by Default**: Services are not exposed to the internet unless explicitly configured. Access is primarily handled via a Tailscale mesh network.

## Core Concepts

The architecture is built on a few key concepts. For more detailed information, please refer to the specific documentation pages.

- **[Git-based Autopull](./../services/git-autopull.md)**: The homelab automatically stays in sync with this repository using a systemd-based Git pull and redeploy mechanism. This is the backbone of the automated workflow.

- **Container Management**: All services run as Docker containers, defined in Docker Compose files within the `stacks/` directory.

  - **[Watchtower](./../services/watchtower.md)** handles automatic updates for container images.
  - **[Netdata](./../services/netdata.md)** provides real-time performance monitoring.

- **Networking**:

  - Services are accessed internally via the Tailscale network.
  - Public access can be configured using Cloudflare Tunnels (though this is not the default).

- **[Troubleshooting](./../troubleshooting)**: Common issues, especially those related to SELinux, are documented in the troubleshooting section.

## Reasoning

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Using Git as the single source of truth makes the system easy to version, replicate, and recover.
- **Simplicity**: The stack relies on well-known, standard tools like Docker, Docker Compose, systemd, and Git, making it easy to understand and maintain.
- **Security**: The "internal-only by default" approach, combined with the use of `socket-proxy` to limit Docker API exposure, minimizes the attack surface.

## Getting Started

To bootstrap a new homelab host with this configuration, run the following command:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kisinga/homelab/main/scripts/setup.sh)"
```

This will clone the repository, set up the required directories, and start the automated deployment services.

**Before running the script**, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with your specific environment variables. An example is provided in `.env.example`.

## Directory Structure

- `/srv/homelab`: The Git repository is cloned here.
- `/srv/homelab-data`: Persistent data for services is stored here, outside of the Git repository, to keep data separate from code.

## üß≠ Prime Directive

Run **any** OCI workload, keep it up-to-date, and expose only with intent:

- Internal-only by default
- VPN-first via **Tailscale Serve**
- Public via **Cloudflare Tunnel** _(DNS automation pending)_

## üóÇ Directory Layout

```bash
# ¬†Code¬†&¬†compose files
/srv/homelab
‚îú‚îÄ stacks/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ core.yml
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NETDATA_README.md  # Details for Netdata monitoring

```

_Ownership_: `groot:docker`, `0775` on both roots.
_SELinux_: `chcon¬†-Rt¬†svirt_sandbox_file_t¬†/srv/homelab /srv/homelab-data`

---

## üì¶ Core Stack (`stacks/core.yml`)

_External file‚Äî_:

> All services mount subdirs under `/srv/homelab-data`, **never inside the repo**.
> Monitoring services like Netdata use Docker named volumes for their own data.

## üõ† Systemd Units

| Unit                      | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `homelab-core.service`    | Starts core stack (no Git dependency) |
| `homelab-gitpull.service` | Pulls latest repo and redeploys stack |
| `homelab-gitpull.timer`   | Triggers the above every 5 minutes    |
| `.git/hooks/post-merge`   | Local fallback redeploy               |

Unit files live in `systemd/` and are deployed via `scripts/setup.sh`. They always run as user `groot`, with `docker` group permissions.

## üåê Networking Recipes & Service Access

| Scenario       | Command                                                 | Access Example (via Tailscale)            |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Tailnet HTTPS  | `sudo tailscale serve --bg https://localhost:8080`      | `https://your-tailscale-device-name:443`  |
| Public tunnel  | `cloudflared tunnel run homelab` _(automation pending)_ | `https://your-public-domain.com`          |
| **Netdata UI** | (Handled by Docker port mapping)                        | `http://your-tailscale-device-name:19999` |

Always access internal services over port **443** in Tailnet for services exposed via `tailscale serve`. Other services like Netdata are accessed directly via their mapped port over the Tailscale network.

## üß™ Troubleshooting

| Symptom                        | Diagnostic                              | Resolution                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Container cannot write         | `docker logs¬†<id>`                      | Relabel `/srv/homelab-data/<svc>`    |
| Watchtower "permission denied" | `docker logs watchtower`                | Check `socket-proxy` logs & config   |
| Netdata permission issues      | `docker logs netdata`                   | Check `socket-proxy` & volume mounts |
| HTTPS fails                    | `curl¬†127.0.0.1:8080` OK?               | Use `tailscale serve` port¬†443       |
| Git pull broke stack           | `journalctl -u homelab-gitpull.service` | Roll back commit; volumes safe       |

## üß∞ QoL Helpers

- `scripts/mkservice.sh` ‚Üí scaffolds service + matching `/srv/homelab-data/<svc>`

---

## üöß Roadmap

- [ ] Enable Watchtower with private registry (GHCR)
- [ ] Add `.labels` file to auto-run `tailscale serve`
- [ ] Add `monitoring.yml` stack with Prometheus + Grafana (Netdata in `core.yml` provides initial metrics)
- [ ] Add Matrix or Shoutrrr alerts on failed units

---

## üßµ End-State

- No open ports
- Config-as-code via Git
- Data-separated from deployment
- Bare-metal recovery in **<10 min**

With just:

- This doc
